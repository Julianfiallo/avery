    <b>Did you re-write this at all?</b><br>
    Actually, yeah. I re-wrote this piece about 4 times before getting something that
    I really liked. You can find all of the past versions in the Past Names tab, after
     the winter concert.<br><br>
    <b>How does Avery feel getting a piece written for him?</b><br>
    He said he feels pretty special. He also said that this takes memeing to a whole
    new level.<br><br>
    <b>How long did it take you to make the website?</b><br>
    About 30 minutes for everything, excluding the questions.<br><br>
