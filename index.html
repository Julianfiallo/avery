  <p class="text-body">An Ode to Avery Clark is a student-written overture, composed for the spring concert.
    It's written as a remembrance to the good times Avery Clark brought the band, and it's
    our way of showing how much we will miss him when he transfers to the Czech Republic.<br><br>
    You will find all the parts for the piece organized by type of instrument above, where
    it says <i>Parts</i></p>
