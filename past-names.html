  <p class="text-body">This all started in the percussion group chat. Max had just written
    a cadence for the drumline, and someone jokingly mentioned really long names for songs.
    Well one was "Max Curtis and the Hunt For Avery Clark: A Perilous Expedition". That name
    became the song that I wrote for you guys now.<br>
    The name took many revisions, from that to "The Hunt for Avery Clark: A Perilous Expedition",
    to "The Hunt for Avery Clark", then to "A Memoir to Avery Clark", then finally to the
    name you guys know now. "An Ode to Avery Clark".</p>
